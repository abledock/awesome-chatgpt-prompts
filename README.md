# Awesome ChatGPT Prompts

![ChatGPT](/media/cover.png)

This is a comprehensive collection of `prompts` or `messages` that you can use with ChatGPT from OpenAI with plenty of practical tips, examples, and best practices to help you get started.

## Introduction to ChatGPT and OpenAI Models

ChatGPT is a language model developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text.

To use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login), a user provides a `prompt` or `message` to the model, and the model generates a response based on its understanding of the input and its training data.

The response generated by ChatGPT is intended to be natural and human-like, and it can be used for a variety of applications, such as

- Translate languages
- Check for Plagiarism
- Create conversational agents
- Tutor in a range of subjects
- Create a natural language interface
- Draft an email or other piece of writing
- Answer questions about a set of documents
- Write code in a specific programming language

This is definitely not an exhasutive list and you will find many more interesting use cases for ChatGPT as you keep learning more about it.

## Best Practices for Working with ChatGPT

Here are some best practices for working with ChatGPT to ensure that you're getting the most out of the model:

- **Provide Clear and Concise Input**: When providing input to the model, it's important to be as clear and concise as possible. This will help the model understand the context of the prompt and generate a more accurate and relevant response. Avoid using overly complex or convoluted language, as this can confuse the model and lead to inaccurate or irrelevant responses.

- **Use Specific and Relevant Keywords**: Using specific and relevant keywords in your prompt can help the model generate a more targeted response. For example, if you want to generate a writing prompt for a romance novel, including keywords like "love," "passion," and "heartbreak" can help the model generate a more relevant and interesting response.

- **Refine and Adjust Prompts as Needed**: The prompts you use with ChatGPT may not always deliver exactly what you're looking for. It's important to refine and adjust the prompts as needed to better suit your specific needs and goals. This could involve adding additional context, tweaking the wording of the prompt, or generating multiple prompts and combining them into a single, more comprehensive prompt.

- **Use Prompts as Inspiration**: The prompts we compiled here should be viewed as inspiration rather than definitive solutions. They can help spark new ideas and creative directions, but they should be used as a starting point rather than a final destination.

- **Experiment with Different Prompt Formats**: ChatGPT can work with a wide range of prompt formats, including short phrases, complete sentences, and even paragraphs of text. Experimenting with different prompt formats can help you find the format that works best for your specific application and goals.

- **Understand the Limitations of the Model**: While ChatGPT is a powerful and versatile tool, it does have limitations. It may struggle with certain types of prompts, such as those involving humor or sarcasm, and it may generate responses that are repetitive or nonsensical. Understanding these limitations can help you work more effectively with the model and achieve better results.

## Collection of ChatGPT Prompts

Typically, a conversation with ChatGPT is formatted with a `system` message first, followed by alternating `user` and `assistant` messages.

- The `system` message helps set the behavior of the assistant.

- The `user` messages help instruct the assistant.

- The `assistant` messages help store prior responses from the model. They can also be used by you to provide the model with examples of desired behaviour.

Here is a standard user message that you can use with any of the system messages listed below.

**User**

> My first request is "{text input here}"

**Note**: The `"{text input here}"` is a placeholder for actual text/context
